# Technical Steering

## Technology Stack
- **Primary Language**: python
- **Architecture**: Component-based pipeline
- **AI Integration**: Claude Code, automated workflows

## Architecture Decisions
- Sequential pipeline processing
- Independent component validation
- AI-assisted development coordination

## Technical Constraints
- Component independence and testability
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance optimization for production

## Code Standards
- Follow language-specific best practices
- Comprehensive testing required
- Documentation for all public interfaces
