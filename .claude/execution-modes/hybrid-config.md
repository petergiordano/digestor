# Hybrid Execution Mode

## Risk Assessment Criteria
- **Code Complexity**: Simple vs complex logic changes
- **File Impact**: Single file vs multiple files
- **System Impact**: Local vs external system changes
- **Reversibility**: Easy to undo vs permanent changes

## Mode Switching Logic
- Start in supervised mode for new projects
- Switch to autopilot for routine, proven actions
- Escalate to supervised for unexpected situations
- Learn from user approval patterns

## Adaptive Learning
- Track user approval/rejection patterns
- Adjust risk assessment based on project history
- Personalize automation level to user preferences
- Improve over time with feedback

## Context Awareness
- Consider current development phase
- Account for deadline pressure
- Adjust for team collaboration needs
- Respect project-specific constraints
