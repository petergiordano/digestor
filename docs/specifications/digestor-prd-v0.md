Here’s a **high-level product specification** using the **SLC (Simple, Lovable, Complete)** framework, plus a phased roadmap.

---

## **Product Specification – “Digestor”**

An app that ingests a user’s newsletters, summarizes them, and presents the content in both text and an **interactive, layered exploration UI**—allowing users to “peel back the onion” from high-level insights to full content, at their chosen depth.

---

### **1. Simple**

**Core Purpose:**
Let users connect their email, automatically fetch newsletters, summarize them into digestible themes, and allow drill-down into deeper layers of information.

**Key MVP Features:**

* **Email integration** (e.g., Gmail, Outlook connectors) to ingest newsletters.
* **Newsletter detection** (filter out replies, ads, signatures).
* **Summarization engine**:

  * High-level thematic summaries.
  * Optional “Show More” to expand any theme into medium-detail or full content.
* **Search & filter** by sender, topic, or date range.
* **Export** to text, markdown, or PDF.

**User Flow (MVP):**

1. Connect email account.
2. Auto-fetch latest newsletters.
3. View themed summary digest.
4. Expand layers interactively.
5. Search and filter results.

### **2. Lovable**

**Delight Factors:**

* **Interactive “onion layers” UI**: click to reveal more detail without losing context.
* **Hover previews** for summaries, showing key quotes or data points.
* **Highlight recurring patterns** across newsletters over time.
* **Personalized insights**: detect trends relevant to the user’s past reads or interests.
* **Link to original articles** for one-click source reading.

**Tone & UX:**

* Clean, distraction-free interface.
* Quick animations when peeling back layers.
* Smart grouping of related ideas.

---

### **3. Complete**

**Ecosystem & Integrations:**

* **Multi-source ingestion** (email, RSS feeds, manual uploads).
* **AI categorization** into custom themes.
* **Knowledge base mode**: cumulative summaries with historical context.
* **Cross-newsletter pattern detection** (e.g., “Topic X is trending across 5 sources this week”).
* **Collaboration features**: share a curated digest with teammates.
* **Offline mode**: download a snapshot of insights for reading without internet.

**Privacy & Security:**

* End-to-end encryption for content storage.
* Local processing option for sensitive content.
* Clear opt-out controls for data retention.

## **Roadmap (3–5 Phases)**

**Phase 1 – MVP (Complete Core Experience)**

* Gmail integration.
* Newsletter filtering & cleaning.
* AI summarization into themes.
* Interactive 3-layer drill-down (summary → detail → full text).

If you want, I can next **mock up** a visual concept for the interactive “onion peel” UI so you can see how the drill-down works. That would help clarify how the MVP would *feel* to a user.
